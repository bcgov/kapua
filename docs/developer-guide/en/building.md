# Building

We use Apache Maven as the build tool of choice.

We use `gitbook` to build the documentation.

## Documentation

Before you can build documentation, you need to install `gitbook`

### gitbook

To install gitbook run

    $ npm install -g gitbook-cli

If you don't have `npm` installed then you would need to install it first.

#### Install npm On Fedora

    $ yum install npm

#### Install npm On Fedora 24

This is what you should do if you are using Fedora 24+.

    $ dnf install nodejs

#### Install npm On Mac-OS

The easiest way would be through brew [brew]

You first install brew using the instructions on the [brew] website.

After you installed brew you can install npm by:

    brew install npm

[brew]: <http://brew.sh>

## Building the docs

To build documentation, run `gitbook build` from either `docs/developer-guide/en` or `docs/user-manual/en`
